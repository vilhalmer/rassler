Hello there! rassler.js is a simple node server to generate RSS feeds from the
Youtube v3 API, now that v2 is completely gone. Toss this on a server somewhere
and request /feed/[username] to get the appropriate RSS feed.

You will need:
- A Google API key, which you can get at https://console.developers.google.com/.
  Don't forget to enable the Youtube v3 API for the project as well.
- Somewhere to host it
- Node 0.12.2 (Might work on some slightly older ones, doesn't work on 0.10.)
- The node modules 'rss' and 'moment' (npm install rss moment)

Place your API key into the appropriate slot in rassler.conf, and tweak the rest
of the options as appropriate while you're there. It will also need read/write
access to the directory it lives in so it can write its channel info cache. (The
cache isn't strictly necessary, but just further cuts down the number of API
calls needed. Feel free to toss it whenever.)

Things to be improved:
- There's some simple error checking, but it hasn't been thoroughly tested.
  Assuming the API behaves, you shouldn't need to worry about it much.
- It will return a 404 if something goes wrong, but doesn't serve an actual
  error page. This isn't too big of an issue since it will be primarily consumed
  by RSS clients, but would be nice to have.
- The cache is permanent, and there's no way to disable it. Playlist IDs are
  unique and should never change, so the only issue this causes is that the
  channel name/avatar/description will never update. As mentioned before, you
  can safely remove the cache at any time to reset it.
